This is very different in spirit than lattice\napproaches. It also is free from sign or phase problems. Also, because our matrices are\ndiagonal, we have only 6.NV degrees of freedom, so N can be made large at moderate cost.\nUsing the SrLiic Monte-Carlo code, al iy will address the questions above for #L particularly\nsimple class of wave functions, namely those described by equation 1. For these wave\nfunctions the geometry of the cigenvalues looks like a five-sphere with a hole in the center,\nso we are not studying the process of topology changes. We are fixing the topology at the\nbeginning. The issue we will study seems very mundane: how do we measure the radius\nof the hole? Since these are wave functions of fixed topology, we will not address the first\nquestion above at all: the topology is known so we do not need an algorithm to figure it out.\nWe also have chosen the orientation of the feature on the sphere and do not have to orient\nthe data to analyze the geometry. Given this, we can see by eye the topology on these simple\nsituations by projecting the particles positions on the 2 plane. The more general problem of\nalso determining the topology for a random configuration with a complicated wave function\nwould be hard: we would need to find a way to do pattern recognition on these distributions\nto define topology. Hegarding measurement of size, we propose various definitions of the\nsize of the simplest geometric features and we study their virtues and failings. In particular,\nto simplify matters further, we want to characterize the simplest such non-trivial feature:\nthe radius of the hole compared to the radius of the sphere. In the end, from the different\nchoices of definitions of the radius at finite .W., one such class of measurements seems to give\nan optimal solution to the problem. For this particular class of observables we can then\naddress the 1/.N corrections in more detail. The definitions we use are simple to describe,\nbut that does not mean that they are optimal. We can only say that they are optimal only\n\nwithin the choices we have."

In determining 2020 expense, the\nexpected rate of return on U.S. plan assets remained constant at 6.00%, primarily based on our target allocations and expected long-term asset\nreturns. The long-term rate of return assumption is calculated using a quantitative approach that utilizes unadjusted historical returns and asset\nallocation as inputs for the calculation. For all U.S. plans, we adopted the Pri-2012 mortality tables and the MP-2020 improvement scale published in\nOctober 2020. We applied the Pri-2012 tables based on the constituency of our plan population for union and non-union participants. We adjusted the\niImprovenrvent scale to utilize the Proxy 554 Long Term Improvement Rates (\u201cLTIR\"), consistent with assumptions adopted by the Social Security\nAdministration trustees, based on long-term historical experience. Currently, we believe this approach provides the best estimate of our future\nobligation. Most plan participants elect to receive plan benefits as a lump sum at the end of service, rather than an annulty. As such, the updated\n\nmortality tables had an immaterial &ffect on our pension obligation."
