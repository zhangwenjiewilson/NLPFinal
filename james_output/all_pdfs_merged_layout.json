The mapping to low\nenergy effective Hamiltonian is exact, without truncation errors in traditional perturbation series\nexpansions. This model consists of a honeycomb lattice of clusters of four spin-1/2 moments, and\ncontains short-range interactions up to six-spin(or eight-spin) terms. The spin in the Kitaev model\nis represented not as these spin-1/2 moments, but as pseudo-spin of the two-dimensional spin singlet\nsector of the four antiferromagnetically coupled spin-1/2 moments within each cluster. Spin corre-\nlations in the Kitaev model are mapped to dimer correlations or spin-chirality correlations in this\nmodel. This exact construction is quite general and can be used to make other interesting spin-1/2\nmodels from spin rotation invariant Hamiltonians. We discuss two possible routes to generate the\nhigh order spin interactions from more natural couplings, which involves perturbative expansions\nthus breaks the exact mapping, although in a controlled manner."

In determining 2020 expense, the\nexpected rate of return on U.S. plan assets remained constant at 6.00%, primarily based on our target allocations and expected long-term asset\nreturns. The long-term rate of return assumption is calculated using a quantitative approach that utilizes unadjusted historical returns and asset\nallocation as inputs for the calculation. For all U.S. plans, we adopted the Pri-2012 mortality tables and the MP-2020 improvement scale published in\nOctober 2020. We applied the Pri-2012 tables based on the constituency of our plan population for union and non-union participants. We adjusted the\nimprovement scale to utilize the Proxy SSA Long Term Improvement Rates (\"LTIR\"), consistent with assumptions adopted by the Social Security\nAdministration trustees, based on long-term historical experience. Currently, we believe this approach provides the best estimate of our future\nobligation. Most plan participants elect to receive plan benefits as a lump sum at the end of service, rather than an annuity. As such, the updated\nmortality tables had an immaterial effect on our pension obligation."
