This model consists of a honeycomb lattice of clusters of four spin-1/2 moments, and contains short-range interactions up to six-spin(or eight-spin) terms.

This exact construction is quite general and can be used to make other interesting spin-1/2 models from spin rotation invariant Hamiltonians. We discuss two possible routes to generate the high order spin interactions from more natural couplings, which involves perturbative expansions thus breaks the exact mapping, although in a controlled manner.",

Our focus has been in the wet gas and   oil prone portions of the play. We estimate we could drill up to 5,500 net wells on our Eagle Ford acreage and plan   to utilize an average of 23 operated rigs in 2011 to further develop our leasehold position in the Eagle Ford Shale.
